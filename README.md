# Password Creator

## Description

The aim of this project was to create an application that can be used to generate a random password based on the user’s chosen criteria.

The project specified that the application should run in the browser and include HTML and CSS that is dynamically updated by JavaScript, as well as an interface that is responsive and adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The project criteria further specified that the application should prompt users for the following password choices:

* Character choices (including uppercase, numerical and special)
* Password length (between 8 and 128)

Upon submitting their preferences, the project criteria states that the generated password (based on the user’s choices) should either be displayed in an alert or written to the page. 

## Build

As per the project criteria, the application’s functionality has been built using Javascript.

While the starter HTML and CSS code has been tested to ensure it meets the project criteria (i.e. updates dynamically and is responsive to multiple screen sizes), no updates were deemed necessary to meet the criteria at this stage (i.e. in this iteration of the project).

The Javascript code has been commented throughout with pseudocode, breaking the project into tasks and sub-tasks (labelled as ‘TASKS’). Thorough comments to explain the developer’s understanding and rationale have also been included in the code (labelled as ‘WORKINGS’).
